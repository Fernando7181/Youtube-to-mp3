# Youtube to mp3

# Reason for the project  
I've always used online YouTube to mp3 convertors for personal projects on Adobe Premiere and I had to sit for several minutes waiting for my file to be downloaded.
when I noticed that I could make my own personal project, so there are Ads and a big waiting time for you to wait for the video for you to be downloaded.

So If you like the idea I would be more than happy to know that more people are interested on projects like that.
